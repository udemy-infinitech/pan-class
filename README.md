Here is a detailed README explaining the key parts of this script:

# VPC Network Creation Script

This Bash script automates the creation of VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and VM instance deployment on Google Cloud.

## Features

- Prompts user for project ID, region, zone, IP ranges
- Checks if networks already exist, creates them if not
- Creates subnets in each network 
- Opens firewall rules to allow full access 
- Lists available VM images and prompts user to select one
- Allows user to provide SSH public key or use default
- Creates deployment manager config from template
- Deploys or updates stack with instance
- Prints public IP and waits for it to be reachable

## Usage

1. Download the script and config template

2. Run the script:

```
chmomd +x add-pan-in-gcp.sh
./add-pan-in-gcp.sh
```

3. Follow the prompts to provide details like project ID, region, VM image etc.

4. The script will create the networks, deploy VM instance, and output its public IP.

5. Wait for the instance to fully boot and then SSH in as user "admin".

## Assumtions
You need to be logged into gcloud

## Implementation Details

- Uses gcloud CLI to create all infrastructure
- Leverages Deployment Manager to deploy VM instance
- Spinner function provides interactive feedback during long-running tasks
- Checks for existing resources before creating to allow re-running script
- Templatizes Deployment Manager config for easy customization
- Waits and retries connecting to VM public IP until online

## Customization

- Edit the config template `expanded-config.yaml` to customize VM properties
- Adjust IP ranges if needed
- Set default project/region/zone at top of script
- Change `admin` SSH user as required

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure gcloud CLI is authenticated and has necessary permissions 
- Check `error_output.log` for any failures
- Verify network and firewall rules are created if deployment fails
- Try manually connecting to printed public IP to test VM accessibility

## Installing Gcloud
To install the gcloud CLI, you can follow the instructions provided in the official Google Cloud CLI documentation[1][2]. Here are the general steps:

1. Confirm that you have a supported version of Python. The Google Cloud CLI requires Python 3 (3.5 to 3.9).
2. Add the gcloud CLI distribution URI as a package source.
3. Import the Google Cloud public key.
4. Update your system and install the Google Cloud CLI package.
5. Optionally, install additional components such as kubectl or deployment extensions of App Engine.

Here's an example of how to install the gcloud CLI on Ubuntu:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the following command to add the gcloud CLI distribution URI as a package source:

   ```
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
   ```

3. Import the Google Cloud public key:

   ```
   curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -
   ```

4. Update your system and install the Google Cloud CLI package:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
   ```

5. Optionally, install additional components such as kubectl or deployment extensions of App Engine:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install kubectl google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python-extras google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-java
   ```

After installation is complete, you can run the `gcloud init` command to initialize the gcloud CLI and configure your installation. The installer also gives you the option to create Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts, start the Google Cloud CLI shell, and configure the gcloud CLI. Make sure that you leave the options to start the shell and configure your installation selected[1][2][4].
