Here is a detailed README explaining the key parts of this script:

# VPC Network Creation Script

This Bash script automates the creation of VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and VM instance deployment on Google Cloud.

## Features

- Prompts user for project ID, region, zone, IP ranges
- Checks if networks already exist, creates them if not
- Creates subnets in each network 
- Opens firewall rules to allow full access 
- Lists available VM images and prompts user to select one
- Allows user to provide SSH public key or use default
- Creates deployment manager config from template
- Deploys or updates stack with instance
- Prints public IP and waits for it to be reachable

## Usage

1. Download the script and config template

2. Run the script:

```
chmomd +x add-pan-in-gcp.sh
./add-pan-in-gcp.sh
```

3. Follow the prompts to provide details like project ID, region, VM image etc.

4. The script will create the networks, deploy VM instance, and output its public IP.

5. Wait for the instance to fully boot and then SSH in as user "admin".

## Assumtions
You need to be logged into gcloud

## Implementation Details

- Uses gcloud CLI to create all infrastructure
- Leverages Deployment Manager to deploy VM instance
- Spinner function provides interactive feedback during long-running tasks
- Checks for existing resources before creating to allow re-running script
- Templatizes Deployment Manager config for easy customization
- Waits and retries connecting to VM public IP until online

## Customization

- Edit the config template `expanded-config.yaml` to customize VM properties
- Adjust IP ranges if needed
- Set default project/region/zone at top of script
- Change `admin` SSH user as required

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure gcloud CLI is authenticated and has necessary permissions 
- Check `error_output.log` for any failures
- Verify network and firewall rules are created if deployment fails
- Try manually connecting to printed public IP to test VM accessibility
